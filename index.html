      <p> We want to spread awareness and educate the public on the dangers of human trafficking. We hope that through our website, people will become better equipped to fight against human trafficking and, thus, lower the rate of cases. Our website features background information, statistics, tips, resources, and more to help those in potentially dangerous situations escape, as well as help survivors fight the trauma they faced. </p>

      <h2 class="whatIsTrafficking"> What is Human Trafficking? </h2>
      <p> Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery. It consists of illegally transporting individuals by force or deception for financial gain. It has become the third most profitable business for organized crime. Human trafficking is separated into three categories: sex trafficking, labor trafficking, and the removal of organs. Some means of control used by human traffickers are the seizing of travel documentation, the threat of deportation, and violence against the victims or their family members. </p>
      <p> Human trafficking wasn't illegal until 2000, when the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was passed, which made it a federal crime. </p>
      <p> Generally, human traffickers scout for victims through the internet, employment agencies, the media, and local contacts. Human traffickers often target those who are driven by unfavorable living conditions to seek the services of a smuggler and view these services as an opportunity to acquire better living conditions in stable environments. The majority of the victims voluntarily leave their origin country, bribed with false opportunities, passports, or visas, but are unaware that they are being recruited for human trafficking. Once they reach the destination country, victims are usually physically and sexually abused and forced into labor or the sex trade in order to pay off their debts for their transportation debts. </p>
      <div class="typesOfExploitation">
        <h4><b> Types of Exploitation</b> </h4>
          <p> Sex trafficking is the most prevalent form of human trafficking, accounting for 58 percent of all trafficking activities. This covers forced prostitution, pornography, child sex rings, and sex-related occupations such as modeling. These victims are exposed to inhumane and potentially fatal conditions, such as prevalent sexually-transmitted diseases. </p>
          <p> These days, forced labor takes on many different forms and can easily go unnoticed. Some examples of forced labor include debt bondage and contract slavery. Additionally, they can also be forced into domestic service, agriculture, sweatshops, and restaurant and hotel work.</p>
          <p id="statistics"> Trafficked children are often forced into domestic servitude, small-scale industries, manufacturing operations, military service, the entertainment industry, and the sex industry. They are required to work for excessive amounts of time in hazardous working conditions for little to no money. “Street children” are used for prostitution, theft, begging, or drug trading. </p>
          <p> More recently, there have been reports of involuntarily removing bodily organs for transplant. There have been incidents of harvesting organs from executed prisoners and of removing and transporting organs by medical employees. There have also been unconfirmed rumors of using human fetuses for use in the cosmetics and drug industries. </p>

        <p id="mostWanted" class="statsPoints"><p> Globally, approximately 1,000,000 people become victims of human trafficking each year. <br> 
        <p>The United States is one of the largest destinations for sex-trafficking with 20,000 to 50,000 people trafficked there each year.<br>
        <p>The top three states with the most human trafficking activity are California, New York and Texas.<br>
        <p>Estimates suggest that, internationally, only about .04% survivors of human trafficking cases are identified, meaning that the vast majority of cases of human trafficking go undetected.<br> </p>
